This is a simple linear regression with nurmenical analysis.Hear I use best fit line algrithm to predict the SAT score. There are 84 entries so the dataset is not good ebough for machibe learning. But this this my very first project. So, I choose the dataset.At the first I calculate the best fit line function. Using this fuction I calculate the predicted value. But the accurace rate totally frustrated me. It is only 40%!!I don'tknow what'sthe problem is! So, I decided to use gradient decent algorithm to ceck the accurace rate.If I got the same accurace rate than I can confidently tell that the dataset is not good enough for machine learning.
