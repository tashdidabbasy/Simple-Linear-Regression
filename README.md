This is a simple linear regression with nurmenical analysis.Hear I use numerical analysis to predict SAT score. There are 84 entries. I calculate the best fit line function . Using this fuction I calculate the predicted value of SAT.But the accurace rate is frustrated me. It is only 40%!! So, I decided to use gradient decent
 algorithm and ceck the accurace rate.
